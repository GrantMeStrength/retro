# Jester Games

In this directory are versions of the games tweaked to run on the Jester SD-Card system for the Minstrel 4th device.
Just download the TAP files and copy to the SD card on your PC/Mac, and then follow the Jester instructions for loading.
All games start with the 'g' word.

So for example, the process to play Frogger would be:

255 239 OUT 0 0 BLOAD jad
64680 call FROGGER

## Update

ROBHUNT2 fixes a bug that stopped some sounds. It may or may not be better as a result :-)
