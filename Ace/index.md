## Jupiter Ace Software

Here you will find a collection of games for the Jupiter Ace microcomputer, written by me in around 1984. They are mostly in FORTH, with the occasional Z80 assembler for sound effects, or extra-fast scrolling routine.

I had planned to make my fortune by selling these games to Boldfield Limited Computer, the company that had bought the assets of Jupiter Cantab. Sadly that did not work out, so they're still all my intellectual property (I am using the term lightly :))

## Writing games for the Ace

The Jupiter Ace had a character mapped screen, with a limited number of User Defined Graphics. This meant writing games with smooth animation was a challenge.

At once point I investigated if I could fake a kind of higher resolution by playing the User Defined Graphics on the screen and then writing into them - hoping to get a 256 by 192 resolution screen. Unfortunately writing to the UDG memory every frame quickly caused it to be become corrupt, so I had to give up that approach.

## Files

The games can be downloaded in  TAP format, and used on various emulators and recreations of the hardware.

Note: Some games use IN to read the keyboard port, and these won't work on anything other than the real hardware.

I hope to get around to updating them to work in a more emulator-friendly way.


## Thanks

Thanks to the [Jupiter Ace Archive Site](https://jupiter-ace.co.uk) for recovering, capturing and storing my software. Without them, they'd have been lost forever.
