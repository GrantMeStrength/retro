## Retro Stuff

My collection of pandemic-started retrocomputing projects. Some of this information is purely for my benefit as my memory isn't great and is tested by hopping between 8 bit CPUs and other retro systems, so don't expect a lot of exposition here. I hope there are at least some useful links and ideas.
